# GKI KernelSU SUSFS

Automated GKI kernel builds via GitHub Actions ([Chinese](README.md)/English).

> Not supported on OnePlus ColorOS 14/15. You may need to wipe data after flashing.

Attempted to build a GKI kernel with [hymo mount meta-module](https://github.com/Anatdx/hymo) integration, but the project currently only supports 6.6, so it is not fully merged into the main branch.

Reference release: [hymo+gki](https://github.com/zzh20188/GKI_KernelSU_SUSFS/releases/tag/v2.0.0-r24)

Attempted to build a GKI kernel with [ReSukisu](https://github.com/ReSukiSU/ReSukiSU) integration, reference release: [resukisu+gki](https://github.com/zzh20188/GKI_KernelSU_SUSFS/releases/tag/v2.0.0-r26)

Prebuilt builds support the zero-width fix patch, or you can directly use the [Unicode zero-width fix module](https://t.me/real5ec1cff/268) Xp module.
